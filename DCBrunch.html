<h1 style="color:DeepPink; border: 3px solid black;text-align: center;">Brunch Spots in DC!</h1>
<h2 style="color:CadetBlue;">801</h2>
<p class="p1">801 is a delicious, black-owned brunch spot located in the Shaw neighborhood. Not only does their bottomless brunch come with a flight of juices, but they also serve the best lobster mac and cheese bites!</p>
<h2 style="color:Salmon;">Pinstripes</h2>
<p class="p2">Located in the heart of Georgetown, Pinstripes bottomless mimosas never disappoint! Their mini waffles with fresh berries are also a must have!</p>
<h2 style="color:RoyalBlue;">Peacock Cafe</h2>
<p class="p3">Another favorite in Georgetown is Peacock Cafe, a spot frequented by diplomats and politicians. The shoe string fries are scrumptious!</p>
<h2 style="color:DarkGreen;">Martin's Tavern</h2>
<p class="p4">The famous spot where JFK proposed to Jackie O! The brunch is also a show stopper, especially the potato and egg skillet!</p>
<h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray;">Tatte Bakery</h2>
<p class="p5">Tatte, located in the West End, is a chic brunch stop with sweet, delectable pastries and savory sandwiches! It is also the perfect spot for social media worthy photos!</p>
<h2 class="h2">Thank you for reading! xoxo, Isabella</h2>
